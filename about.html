              <p>My name is Tyler Martin. I am 28 years old, and while I hail from Virginia, I have called many different states and countries home. Currently I live in the Texas Panhandle with my wife and work in the oil industry.</p>
              <p>I consider myself a lifelong learner and am currently looking to expand my skill set in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As my wife and I both love to travel and take-on new adventures it is my hope as a freelance web developer these dreams can be fulfilled.</p>
              <p>A few of my passions include travel, trying new foods, craft beer, and adventuring in the outdoors.</p>
